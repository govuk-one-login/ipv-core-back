Feature: P2 App journey

  Scenario Outline: Successful P2 identity via DCMAW using <doc>
    Given I start a new 'medium-confidence' journey
    Then I get a 'page-ipv-identity-document-start' page response
    When I submit an 'appTriage' event
    Then I get a 'dcmaw' CRI response
    When I submit '<details>' details to the CRI stub
    Then I get a 'page-dcmaw-success' page response
    When I submit a 'next' event
    Then I get an 'address' CRI response
    When I submit 'kenneth-current' details to the CRI stub
    Then I get a 'fraud' CRI response
    When I submit 'kenneth-score-2' details to the CRI stub
    Then I get a 'page-ipv-success' page response
    When I submit a 'next' event
    Then I get an OAuth response
    When I use the OAuth response to get my identity
    Then I get a 'P2' identity
    And an 'IPV_IDENTITY_ISSUED' audit event was recorded [local only]

    Examples:
      | doc      | details                      |
      | passport | kenneth-passport-valid       |
      | DL       | kenneth-driving-permit-valid |
