Feature: Failed TICF responses
  Scenario Outline: TICF CRI returns a <statusCode> during identity proving
    Given TICF CRI will respond with default parameters and
      | statusCode    | <statusCode>                 |
    When I start a new 'medium-confidence' journey
    Then I get a 'page-ipv-identity-document-start' page response
    When I submit an 'appTriage' event
    Then I get a 'dcmaw' CRI response
    When I submit 'kenneth-driving-permit-valid' details to the CRI stub
    Then I get an 'address' CRI response
    When I submit 'kenneth-current' details to the CRI stub
    Then I get a 'fraud' CRI response
    When I submit 'kenneth-score-2' details to the CRI stub
    Then I get a 'page-ipv-success' page response
    When I submit a 'next' event
    Then I get an OAuth response
    When I use the OAuth response to get my identity
    Then I get a 'P2' identity without a TICF VC

    Examples:
      | statusCode |
      | 400        |
      | 500        |

  Scenario: TICF request has a response delay greater than 5s
    Given TICF CRI will respond with default parameters and
      | responseDelay | 10         |
    When I start a new 'medium-confidence' journey
    Then I get a 'page-ipv-identity-document-start' page response
    When I submit an 'appTriage' event
    Then I get a 'dcmaw' CRI response
    When I submit 'kenneth-driving-permit-valid' details to the CRI stub
    Then I get an 'address' CRI response
    When I submit 'kenneth-current' details to the CRI stub
    Then I get a 'fraud' CRI response
    When I submit 'kenneth-score-2' details to the CRI stub
    Then I get a 'page-ipv-success' page response
    When I submit a 'next' event
    Then I get an OAuth response
    When I use the OAuth response to get my identity
    Then I get a 'P2' identity without a TICF VC
