Feature: TICF failed/error journeys

  Rule: Via enhanced-verification journey
    Background: Start TICF enhanced verification journey
      When I start a new 'medium-confidence' journey
      Then I get a 'page-ipv-identity-document-start' page response
      When I submit an 'appTriage' event
      Then I get a 'dcmaw' CRI response
      When I call the CRI stub and get an 'access_denied' OAuth error
      Then I get a 'page-multiple-doc-check' page response
      When I submit a 'ukPassport' event
      Then I get a 'ukPassport' CRI response
      When I submit 'kenneth-passport-valid' details to the CRI stub
      Then I get an 'address' CRI response
      When I submit 'kenneth-current' details to the CRI stub
      Then I get a 'fraud' CRI response

      Then I get a 'page-pre-experian-kbv-transition' page response
      When I submit a 'next' event
      Then I get a 'kbv' CRI response
