  @Build
  Scenario: Successful P2 identity via Web using DL
    Given I start a new 'medium-confidence' journey
    Then I get a 'page-ipv-identity-document-start' page response
    When I submit an 'appTriage' event
    Then I get a 'dcmaw' CRI response
    When I get an 'access_denied' OAuth error from the CRI stub
    Then I get a 'page-multiple-doc-check' page response
    When I submit a 'drivingLicence' event
    Then I get a 'drivingLicence' CRI response
    When I submit 'kenneth-driving-permit-valid' details to the CRI stub
    Then I get an 'address' CRI response
    When I submit 'kenneth-current' details to the CRI stub
    Then I get a 'fraud' CRI response
    When I submit 'kenneth-score-2' details to the CRI stub
    Then I get a 'page-pre-experian-kbv-transition' page response
    When I submit a 'next' event
    Then I get a 'kbv' CRI response
    When I submit 'kenneth-score-2' details to the CRI stub
    Then I get a 'page-ipv-success' page response
    When I submit a 'next' event
    Then I get an OAuth response
    When I use the OAuth response to get my identity
    Then I get a 'P2' identity
    And an 'IPV_IDENTITY_ISSUED' audit event was recorded [local only]
