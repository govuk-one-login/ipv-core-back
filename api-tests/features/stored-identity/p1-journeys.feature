Feature: Stored Identity - P1 journeys
  Background: Enabled stored identity service flag and start p1 journey
    Given I activate the 'storedIdentityService,disableStrategicApp' feature sets
    When I start a new 'low-confidence' journey
    Then I get a 'page-ipv-identity-document-start' page response

  Scenario: Successful stored identity storage - P1 app journey
