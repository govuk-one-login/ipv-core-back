Feature:  Mitigating CIs with enhanced verification using the DCMAW CRI
  Scenario Outline: Same session mitigation via app - successful <attained-vot> attained
    When I start a new '<journey-type>' journey
    Then I get a 'live-in-uk' page response
    When I submit a 'uk' event
    Then I get a 'page-ipv-identity-document-start' page response
    When I submit an 'appTriage' event
    Then I get an 'identify-device' page response
    When I submit an 'appTriage' event
    Then I get a 'pyi-triage-select-device' page response
    When I submit a 'computer-or-tablet' event
    Then I get a 'pyi-triage-select-smartphone' page response with context 'dad'
    When I submit a 'neither' event
    Then I get a 'pyi-triage-buffer' page response
    When I submit an 'anotherWay' event
    Then I get a 'page-multiple-doc-check' page response
    When I submit a 'drivingLicence' event
    Then I get a 'drivingLicence' CRI response
    When I submit 'kenneth-driving-permit-valid' details to the CRI stub
    Then I get an 'address' CRI response
    When I submit 'kenneth-current' details to the CRI stub
    Then I get a 'fraud' CRI response
    When I submit 'kenneth-score-2' details with attributes to the CRI stub
      | Attribute          | Values                   |
      | evidence_requested | {"identityFraudScore":2} |
    Then I get a 'personal-independence-payment' page response
    When I submit a 'end' event
    Then I get a 'page-pre-experian-kbv-transition' page response
    When I submit a 'next' event
    Then I get a 'experianKbv' CRI response
    When I submit 'kenneth-needs-enhanced-verification' details with attributes to the CRI stub
      | Attribute          | Values                                          |

    When I submit an 'iphone' event
    Then I get a 'pyi-triage-mobile-download-app' page response with context 'iphone'
    When the async DCMAW CRI produces a '<document-details>' VC that mitigates the 'NEEDS-ENHANCED-VERIFICATION' CI
    # And the user returns from the app to core-front
    And I pass on the DCMAW callback
    Then I get a 'check-mobile-app-result' page response
    When I poll for async DCMAW credential receipt
    Then the poll returns a '201'
    When I submit the returned journey event
    Then I get a 'page-ipv-success' page response
    When I submit a 'next' event
    Then I get an OAuth response
    When I use the OAuth response to get my identity
    Then I get a '<attained-vot>' identity
