Feature: Mortality check failures
  Background:
    When I start a new 'medium-confidence' journey
    Then I get a 'live-in-uk' page response
    When I submit a 'uk' event
    Then I get a 'page-ipv-identity-document-start' page response
    When I submit an 'appTriage' event
    Then I get an 'identify-device' page response
    When I submit an 'appTriage' event
    Then I get a 'pyi-triage-select-device' page response
    When I submit a 'smartphone' event
    Then I get a 'pyi-triage-select-smartphone' page response with context 'mam'
    When I submit an 'iphone' event
    Then I get a 'pyi-triage-mobile-download-app' page response with context 'iphone'
    When the async DCMAW CRI produces a 'kenneth-passport-valid' VC
          # And the user returns from the app to core-front
    And I pass on the DCMAW callback
    Then I get a 'check-mobile-app-result' page response
    When I poll for async DCMAW credential receipt
    Then the poll returns a '201'
    When I submit the returned journey event
    Then I get a 'page-dcmaw-success' page response
    When I submit a 'next' event
    Then I get an 'address' CRI response
    When I submit 'kenneth-current' details to the CRI stub
    Then I get a 'fraud' CRI response

  Scenario: Mitigated mortality check results in M1C
    When I tell the CIMIT stub that the 'BREACHING' CI is already mitigated
    And  I submit 'kenneth-score-0-mortality-breaching' details with attributes to the CRI stub
      | Attribute          | Values                   |
      | evidence_requested | {"identityFraudScore":1} |
    Then I get a 'page-ipv-success' page response
    When I submit a 'next' event
    Then I get an OAuth response
    When I use the OAuth response to get my identity
    Then I get a 'P2' identity with a fraud VC

  Scenario: Unmitigated mortality check results in failure
    When I submit 'kenneth-score-0-mortality-breaching' details with attributes to the CRI stub
      | Attribute          | Values                   |
      | evidence_requested | {"identityFraudScore":1} |
    Then I get a 'pyi-no-match' page response
    When I submit a 'next' event
    Then I get an OAuth response
    When I use the OAuth response to get my identity
    Then I get a 'P0' identity
