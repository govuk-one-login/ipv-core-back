            When I activate the 'strategicApp,drivingLicenceAuthCheck' feature set
            And I start a new 'medium-confidence' journey
            Then I get a 'page-ipv-reuse' page response
            When I submit a 'update-details' event
            Then I get a 'update-details' page response

        Scenario Outline: Successful name change - <selected-name-change> name change but user updates <actual-name-change> name instead
