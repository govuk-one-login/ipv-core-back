# API tests

- This defines a suite of API tests, designed to test core's functionality without having to use the frontend.
- They are written with TypeScript and orchestrated using Cucumber.
- They can be run against a development environment or the build environment.

## Requirements

- These tests were written with node v20

## Installation

- [Create a GitHub personal access token][create-pat] with package:read scope
- Copy `.npmrc.template` to `.npmrc` and replace `GITHUB_PAT_WITH_READ:PACKAGES` with your personal access token
- Run `npm install`

## Running the tests

There are 3 presets that can be used:

- `npm run test:build` - runs against the deployed build environment
- `npm run test:local` - runs against an already-running local instance of core-back
- `npm run test:ci` - starts a new local instance of core-back and tests against it

Additional arguments can be passed to cucumber, e.g. to include specific tests: `npm test:local -- --name 'F2F'`

If you are using custom configuration, then you can use `npm test` to invoke cucumber without any presets.

### Environment variables

Env variables are provided by [dotenv][dotenv] and read from a `.env` file.
Non-secret values are stored in `.env.build` and `.env.local` for the corresponding environments.

Secret values are stored in `.env`: copy `.env.template` to `.env` and provide appropriate values.

#### Other environments

It is also possible to set up other `.env.<name>` files,
which can be selected by setting `CORE_ENV=<name>` when running the tests.

As an example, to run against a deployment in the dev01 account you could create a `.env.dev01` file something like:

```
CORE_BACK_COMPONENT_ID="https://dev-chrisw.01.dev.identity.account.gov.uk"
CORE_BACK_INTERNAL_API_URL="https://internal-test-api-dev-chrisw.01.dev.identity.account.gov.uk"

```

## Working on the tests

- Cucumber steps are defined in `src/steps`.
- Try to create parameterised steps where possible.
- Don't create new steps unless you're sure one doesn't already exist that fits your need.
- Annotate tests with `@Build` to also be run against the build environment.

## IDE integration

It's a good idea to add the relevant plugins for your IDE or it will struggle to understand the structure of the project.

- For intellij use [Cucumber.js][cucumberjs]
- For VSCode use [Cucumber][cucumber]
  - You might need to configure it with:
    ```
    "cucumber.glue": [
        "api-tests/src/steps/**/*.ts"
    ]
    ```
- Or use something else you like that works, you're a grown up.

### Prettying and linting

The project is configured to use eslint for linting, and prettier for formatting. If you have pre-commit installed it will catch any issues. You can run the tests manually using:

```
npm run lint
```

And then you can fix issues automatically with

```
npm run lint-fix
```
