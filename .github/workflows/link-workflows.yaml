# DO NOT CHANGE THIS FILE
# This action should be kept as small as possible and only do linting of workflow actions as syntax errors in
# actions cause them to silently fail. If you do need to change this file, make sure that you watch it execute
# successfully in GitHub actions as you will not be warned if it fails.
